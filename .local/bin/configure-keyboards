# NOTE: For now, I've disabled the per-keyboard configurations here. For some
# reason, some aspect of the multi-layout configuration makes it such that you
# cannot configure both multi-layout keyboards and single-layout keyboards...

# Set up us<->jp keymap switching for the default keyboard. It turns out that
# configuring this using xorg.conf.d has been broken for more than a decade[1]
# and so it's much simpler to just do it manually.
